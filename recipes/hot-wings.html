    <h3>These wings will be perfect to <em>fire</em> you up before the game!</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds of chicken wings, flats and drums from the frozen section</li>
        <li>2 tsp. garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, if you don't have pepper flakes, you can use paprika</li>
        <li>½ cup Frank’s RedHot® Buffalo Sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the un-frozen wings with salt and pepper and set aside. In a bowl, add the hot sauce, garlic, melted butter, honey, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>In a gallon-sized sealable bag, combine the chicken wings and the sauce. Seal the bag and mix the sauce and chicken until well combined. Refrigerate for a couple of hours to let the chicken marinate.</li>
        <li>In a glass baking dish, arrange chicken pieces in single file. Cover the chicken with the remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Place your chicken on the top rack of the oven and bake for 10-15 minutes. Remove the chicken.</li>
        <li>Transfer your chicken to a broiling pan and broil 2-4 minutes on each side or until your meat thermometer reads 160 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest. Hint: if your chicken seems dry, brush the wings with more sauce. Serve it with some celery, carrots, blue cheese, ranch dipping sauce, or with our favorite potato wedges.</li>
